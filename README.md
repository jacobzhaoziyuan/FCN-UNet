# FCN & UNet Implementation: Vestibular Schwannoma and Cochlea Segmentation from Contrast-enhanced T1 MRI



## Abstract
Segmentation is one of the most important steps in medical image analysis. It aims to accurately divide the image into meaningful groups. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks, particularly fully convolution networks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on semantic image segmentation.  In this work, we mainly reviewed two representative fully convolution networks, i.e., FCN and UNet, and implemented them in one challenging segmentation task, vestibular schwannoma and cochlea segmentation. 

## Reimplemented methods
* [FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038), [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), and [DRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09914)




## Setup

1. Follow official guidance to install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
2. Clone the repo
3. cd code


## Data Preparation
